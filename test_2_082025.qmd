## Definition: High-dimensional data analysis


- Statistical and computational methods for datasets in which each sample is described by a very large number of variables—often thousands or more

  - Rows = samples (n small)

  - Columns = features (p huge)

- Descriptors/features comparable to or exceeds the number of samples

- Specialized tools and approaches are needed to obtain reliable scientific insight [i.e.: regularization, dimensionality reduction]

## Origins of high dimensionality in biomedical and clinical research

- Every major -omics and digital health technology now measures biology at high dimensionality

- Challenge:  𝑝 $\gg$ 𝑛 - when the number of measured variables (p) vastly exceeds the number of samples (n)

- Molecular and clinical measurement technologies in modern biomedicine captures thousands to millions of interrelated features per sample — making high dimensionality an intrinsic property of biological data

## <span style="font-size:80%">Sources of high dimensionality in biomedical and clinical research</span> {.smaller}

Various high-dimensional features map onto patient level data

- Examples

  - **Genomics**: ~20,000 genes; millions of SNPs and variants; 450k–850k CpG methylation sites. Each genome is a vector with millions of entries

  - **Transcriptomics**: RNA-seq measures gene expression across 20k+ transcripts; each sample becomes a 20,000-dimensional point

  - **Proteomics**: Hundreds–thousands of quantified proteins; post-translational modifications multiply effective dimensionality

## <span style="font-size:80%">Sources of high dimensionality in biomedical and clinical research</span> {.smaller}

Datasets enable discovery of disease subtypes, treatment response signatures, pathways, immune states, and phenotypes

- Examples

  - **Metabolomics**: Hundreds–thousands of small molecules capturing both genetic and environmental states

  - **EHR and Wearables**: Longitudinal clinical data contain hundreds of categorical, temporal, and event-based features per patient; continuous sensor data effectively form multivariate time series

## <span style="font-size:80%">Sources of high dimensionality in biomedical and clinical research</span> {.smaller}

- A “biomarker” rarely acts alone; biological meaning arises from patterns across many variables

- Disease subtypes, immune activation, and treatment response live in multivariate structure, not single features

- A number of interesting patterns can arise through visualizing high dimensional data

  - Visualization and modeling reveal latent axes: pathway activation, metabolic shifts, or phenotypic clusters

## <span style="font-size:80%">Limitations of traditional numerical and categorical data visualization</span> {.smaller}

Reminder: what traditional numerical and categorical visuals can do

Plots are helpful in summarizing select high dimensional features

- **Bar charts**: summarize counts of variant classes, tumor subtypes, or sample categories

- **Boxplots**: compare distributions of a single gene/protein across two groups

- **Scatterplots**: show relationships between pairs of numerical variables (e.g., gene expression vs protein abundance)

## <span style="font-size:80%">Limitations of traditional numerical and categorical data visualization</span> {.smaller}

- **Scatterplot**: 

  - shows 2–3 variables 

  - cannot reveal gene modules, proteomic networks, or high-dimensional manifolds

- **Boxplot/bar chart**:

  - cannot summarize 20,000 genes across dozens of samples—signal is diluted by volume

- **Categorical comparisons** (e.g., subtype $\rightarrow$ gene expression) fail because:

  - Biological subtypes depend on thousands of interacting features, not a few

  - Univariate comparisons hide multi-feature relationships

## <span style="font-size:80%">Core functions of High-Dimensional Data Analysis</span> {.smaller}

High-dimensional analysis transforms massive, complex datasets into interpretable structure through five key steps:

- **Compression** — Reduces thousands of variables into 2D or 3D summaries (e.g., PCA, UMAP) to reveal dominant patterns

- **Pattern Discovery** — Uncovers clusters, trajectories, or functional modules that describe biological or clinical variation

- **Organization** — Orders samples or features so meaningful relationships and gradients become visible

- **Denoising** — Filters out technical noise or irrelevant variation, allowing true biological signal to emerge

- **Abstraction** — Elevates raw measurements into conceptual understanding—linking data patterns to mechanisms and insights

## <span style="font-size:80%">HD Analysis and Biomedical Discovery</span> {.smaller}

- High dimensional (HD) data captures heterogeneity, which is where biological insight often lies

- Low-dimensional summaries collapse heterogeneity $\rightarrow$ lose key biological insight

- Discovery of hidden biological states:

  - Cancer subtypes

  - Immune activation/exhaustion states

  - Pathways and modules

  - Rare phenotypic clusters

## <span style="font-size:80%">How High-Dimensional Visualization Reveals Molecular Subtypes</span> {.smaller}

In biomedical science, one of the most important patterns revealed by high-dimensional visualization is the emergence of molecular subtypes—groups of patients or samples that share a coordinated biological program

- Cancer subtypes (e.g., luminal vs. basal TNBC; immune-hot vs. immune-cold tumors) are not visible when examining one gene at a time

- Rare-disease signatures exhibit multi-feature structure: patterns distributed across many correlated genes

- Dimensionality-reduction techniques—like PCA, t-SNE, or UMAP—create visual maps where samples with similar multi-gene expression profiles cluster together

- Subtypes emerge visually as clusters or gradients, revealing hidden heterogeneity within what once looked like a single disease

- Figure shows : breast tumors fall into distinct expression clusters corresponding to the PAM50 molecular subtypes

- Heatmap clustering orders the rows (genes) and columns (samples) so that similar profiles align together

- Red/blue pattern reflects multi-gene expression programs — no single gene defines a subtype

- Each bar of color at the top indicates a PAM50 molecular subtype: Basal, HER2-enriched, Luminal-A, Luminal-B, or Normal-like

## <span style="font-size:80%">Summary</span> {.smaller}

- Modern biomedicine generates inherently high-dimensional data—every sequencing or imaging platform captures thousands of features per patient

- One of the goals of high dimensional data visualization is to convert overwhelming data into a visual model of biological organization

- High dimensional data visualization turns invisibility into structure, revealing patterns like tumor subtypes or immune states that cannot be seen one gene at a time

- Effective visualization translates computation into intuition
